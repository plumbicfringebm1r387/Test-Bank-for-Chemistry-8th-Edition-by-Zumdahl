* * ISBN-13 ‏ : ‎ 978-0547168173
  * * Author: Zumdahl
   
  * CHEMISTRY allows the reader to learn chemistry basics quickly and easily by emphasizing a thoughtful approach built on problem solving. For the Eighth Edition, authors Steven and Susan Zumdahl have extended this approach by emphasizing problem-solving strategies within the Examples and throughout the text narrative. CHEMISTRY speaks directly to the reader about how to approach and solve chemical problems--to learn to think like a chemist--so that they can apply the process of problem-solving to all aspects of their lives.
